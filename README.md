# Solving-Mathematical-equation-Handwritten using CNN
 Handwritten Equation Solver trained by handwritten digits and mathematical symbol using Convolutional Neural Network with some image processing techniques
 
Equation can contain any digit from 0-9 and symbol +,x,- Works on image with white background and digits/symbols are in black.

You can run all the three ipynb files either separately or sequentially.

1. For running Data_extraction.ipynb first download train images.rar zip file and extract it in the folder containing Data_extaction.ipynb file.
2. For running model_training.ipynb, you either need to download train_final.csv or you can run it after succesfully running Data_extraction.ipynb.
3. For running CNN_test.ipynb, you either need to download model_final.h5 and model_final.json file or you can run it after succesfully running model_training.ipynb file. You also need to replace the path of the image in code from the local path of image to be tested on your computer.
